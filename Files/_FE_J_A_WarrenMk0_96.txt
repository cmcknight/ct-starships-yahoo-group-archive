Comments:          Aashi Shipwright and Design of Riramla
Delphi/Riramla/1036 is submitting the J. A. Warren-class Fleet Escort
for consideration per Admiralty's Orders Message # 14630 dated
08-03-08. This vessel utilizes both laser and particle acclerator
weapon systems that eliminates the need to carry reloads for 
expended missile and sandcaster ordnance. A Warren-class escort's
J-4 range permits the vessel to escort most cruisers on any mission
profile. In normal space the Warren class can match or exceed many
cruiser's speed. To add flexibility to raiding missions the wedge
shaped hull allows the vessel to enter an atmosphere to conduct 
strafing missions on ground targets or other ground support missions.
The 28 ton cargo hold can be used for additional supplies for the
raiding task force.

Design by Tom Rux using HG3 0.96 originally submitted approximately
