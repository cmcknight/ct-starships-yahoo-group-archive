J4 M5 Agility-5 The Plankwell illustrates well the compromises that must be 
made to achieve a strategic (J4) mobility standard. Compare the Plankwell with 
the Kokirrak; Amour-10 vs 12, Agility-5 vs 6, Meson screen-4 vs 8. None-the-
less the Plankwell is a capable capital ship.

Added: Backup computers & screens, frozen watch
Improved Meson screen-4. Increased Small craft numbers to 10.
