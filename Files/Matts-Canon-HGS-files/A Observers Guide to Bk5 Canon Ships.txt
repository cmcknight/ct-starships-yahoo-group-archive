*** Introduction
Canon ships are famous for their non-compliance to Canon ship building rules. This has been an exercise in establishing discrepancies in 
Supplement 9, "Fighting Ships" as compared to the ship construction rules in Book 5 "High Guard". Invariably the authors version of 'the 
correct' ship will vary from the readers. To assist the reader in forming their own opinions, a High Guard Shipyard (HGS) file is supplied for each ship.

One, perhaps generous interpretation is that Fighting Ships reflects the Imperial Navies miss-information campaign. Obviously ship 
capabilities are top secret and it should be no surprise that public documents contain deliberate inaccuracies. In that vein, this document 
represents perhaps, only the views of a self-proclaimed naval expert. However those views are explained and ultimately it is up to the reader 
to decide.

*** Excluded & Common Errors
Of the ships in Supplement 9, "Fighting Ships" several ships are noted as being Book 2 Designs, these are excluded from this discussion.

The most common errors in Fighting Ships, are;
Crew Calculations - generally 30% to 50% under High Guard requirements
Suggested prices in general are too high.
J3 ships described in text as J4, adherence to the Imperiums J4 M6 stated fleet manoeuvre standard, is 'loose'.
Batteries Bearing are often incorrect
Assumption that turret batteries always default to the largest battery. (ie: missile-7 batteries)

*** Interesting rules use;
Heavy Fighter crew use accommodation in their fighters, consequently they are excluded from frozen watch calcs.
The original Azhanti High Lightening (FI) 'works' if the design utilizes the fuel within the fuel shuttles to satisfy J5 & pp fuel needs
The Gazelle drop tank adding displacement sufficient to allow an extra hardpoint. This requires a rethink, is it really a 'drop tank' in the conventional sense...

*** Debateable Rules use;
Armour-0 is free. There are two schools of thought, one that Armour-0 = no armour at all (ie: just a very thin hull skin) and is free, the other that Armour-0 = basic armour for ship operations (vs radiation, micrometeorites & minor knocks) and costs in tons & MCr. For the full debate, just ask on CT-starships :-) My personal view is probably obvious, but we have all been using Armour-0 is free for many years.

The ships listed here, I have included the cost of Armour-0. Just assume its cargo space it you prefer or just delete it in HGS (F12 section).

HGS v1.14 can be found in the Files section of the yahoo group CT-Starships. As at the time of writing, it is the most recent version.
Known errors in HGS:
   0.   f7 tab, 50tn bays. TL15 50tn Repulsor bays are showing as #3 rather than #5. It does show the correct stat on the data card.
   1.   Purification Plants do not take into account Drop Tank Fuel. Drop tanks do not need to be dropped.
   2.   Turrets batteries fill up all turrets, using more Mcr & EP's than necessary in some circumstances. (eg: Beam-5 requires 10 Beam Lasers, 
HGS allocating with 4 triple turrets forces 12 Beam lasers to be purchased rather than 10 plus 2 empty mounts.)
   3.   Set small craft bridge = yes, book 2 crew, options-autocalc accommodations = y & one crew (pilot).  Couches autocalc to -1.
   4.   Mixed turrets = y, does not reset turrets menu. Can result in the exported USP showing shadow batteries. Set ton = 50, turret = 1x single
turret beam. Then set mixed turrets = y, set one double turret, one sand, one missile. Ship card is ok. Export USP adds 1 laser battery factor-0
   5.   Crew settings "Other". Autocalc accomodations ignores "Other" when setting crew accomodations "Actual" (not "Minimum" but "Actual").
   6.   Won't allow mixed turrets with standard turrets.
   7.   Emergency low berths not charged for in small craft.
   8.   Mixed turrets, set laser "number" to 1. Click "ok" then re-open (f8), lasers reset to factor 0. Ships card reads ok.
   9.   Staterooms, no option to not have staterooms in large craft. eg 400tn fuel shuttles or 1200tn assault landers.
   10. Fractional PP not supported, forces PP to reflect an arbitrary stat not the ships EP needs  (USP factor is the fractional PP rounded down)
   11. Mixed turrets get 1 gunner per turret, should require 1 gunner per battery. (Differant rules for small craft)
   12. User defined components should be listed in Ship card & exported USP
   13. Low berths cost 150,000Cr, should be 50,000Cr
   14. Refit option doesn't work
reported 300509
   15. Mixed turrets  should include mixed Energy Weapon turrets (ie: Fusion gun + Sandcaster)
reported circa 150609
   16. Spinal mounts, PA or Meson checked, but no weapon chosen, leads to 1 BB factor-0 spinal mount shown in exported USP.
   17. Passenger staterooms, should include a double occupancy option for Navy personel in transit
   18. Related to error 5. Switch autocalc crew accomodation to off. If supplied staterooms are too low, but within the number of 'other' crew from the minimum, then the warning 'Invalid Design' does not come up.
   19. Choice of Armour rules interpretation, Armour-0 is free and Armour-0 costs.
   20. "Insufficienr small craft couches" prevents the user leaving the accomodation screen until resolved (unlike other issues)
   21. Optional Small Craft hangers in Dispersed Structure designs

The two small craft staterooms enables the crew to undertake long patrols as well as provide comfortable accommodation for the two crew 
whom live on board permanently, removing the need to provide accommodation on the carrier. Another effect is that frozen watch calcs ignore the crafts crew...

to their destinations in the shortest possible time. A pool of Fleet Couriers is attached to each fleet and naval base, with couriers constantly 
moving between Fleet pools as they deliver their charges. Whilst armed for self defence, use as combat or recon ships is frowned upon.

Notes:
J4 M4 Agility-0 The Gazelle close escort utilises modular construction, part of which is a 100tn modular de-mountable jump fuel tank 
mounting a remote turret and secured with explosive fittings for 'fast' demounting. This method harks back to the original drop tank experiments, refining the concept eventually to just a cheap disposable drop tank. Still it is popularly thought of as a drop tank, 
however 'dropping' it requires replacing the modular tank, turret, weapon system and explosive mountings. This takes two weeks of repairs in a Shipyard costing .04 Mcr, before the new tank module with turret, may be mounted at a cost of 3.15 Mcr, taking a further 2 weeks. Needless to say, whilst a very useful 'trick', self inflicted damage will require explanation to a Navy Board of Inquiry.

The Fiery class differs in having a streamlined hull without the explosive fittings. The 100tn fuel tank is still demountable.

Jump capacity is J-4, J5 if modular tank is jettisoned at jump, J2 if modular tank is already gone
Manoeuvre Drive is M-4, M5 if the modular tank is not present.
Agility-0 is unmodified regardless of modular tank status.
Power Plant is PP-6 (note, dropping modular tank also drops the 3EP Beam battery)
Model 6 computer, no fibre optics, per original.
Book 2 crew.

Jump Fuel is all internal tankage (picture Drop Tanks permanently fixed, 
armoured as per hull & mounting a triple Beam turret. IMHO they 
might be fixed using explosive mounts, giving tactical options, but at a huge 
cost in repairs & loss of the turret. The gunner would be operating the 
turret remotely and therefore safe if it is ejected.)

Notes:
J4 M6 Agility-6. Procured to escort unarmed ships in the war zone, which it does admirably with its large offensive armament. However, the 
Fer-de-lance designers saw fit to ensure it also met Fleet mobility standards, giving rise to speculation that the transport protection role was 
merely the excuse to raise funding for a new class of escort. Regardless, in practise most Fer-de-lance squadrons are assigned to escorting 
main battle fleets.

J4 M2 Agility-2 As a hospital ship, this vessel is unarmed and unarmoured, the carried small craft are 
likewise unarmed.

The smallcraft are 20tn Gigs with two crew trained as field medics. Capacity for 
passengers and wounded are included.A standard 50tn dock is included for fast 
transfer of patients from Imperial 50tn small craft.

The hospital module provides capacity for 100 patients, two surgeries and 
support facilities operated by 25 medical staff. The 400Mcr price tag is a 
guestimate based on 1Mcr per ton.

In peace time the Girianus with its Close Escorts, shows the flag and provides its services to the populations of disadvantaged worlds.

From Grand Fleet, Avenger Enterprises.

As a hospital ship, this vessel is unarmed and unarmoured, the carried small 
craft are likewise unarmed.

The smallcraft are 20tn Gigs with two crew trained as field medics. Capacity for 
passengers and wounded are included. A 50tn dock is included for fast 
transfer of wounded from standard Imperial 50tn craft.

The hospital module provides capacity for 1000 patients, multiple surgeries and 
support facilities operated by 200 medical staff. The price tag is a 
guestimate based on 1Mcr per ton.

Notes:
J5 M5 Agility 5 gives excellent Strategic range enabling the Light Cruiser to react fast to events as they happen. Smaller than the big 
battlewagons and with 50% of the ship dedicated to jump fuel, it sacrifices armour, manoeuvre and spinal mount size. However as a Capital 
ship it is more than a match for any opposition short of a Battle Fleet and it's considerably cheaper to deploy and man than a Battleship. Light 
Cruisers will be found on deployment throughout the Imperium either alone, in pairs or as the flagship for a task force.

Many commentators have assumed the turret mounted missile batteries are few and large (20x missile-7). However it is a strength of the 
Gionetti that the configuration may be changed during construction or a refit to better reflect the Captains preferences. Many favour an 
arrangement useful for swamping the defences of large enemy ships (eg: 100x missile-4) at the cost of sacrificing cargo space for gunnery 
crew accommodation.

Notes:
J0 M6 Agility-6  Planetoid Monitors offer cost savings and advantages when facing invading forces, yet their true worth isn't in combat, its in 
merely existing, forcing the invader to increase the size of their invading fleet considerably or look for easier targets.

Many options exist for arming and equipping monitors. Usually purchased on a budget by cash strapped governments, the specifications are 
often downgraded even as the vessel is constructed. What remains is a very large, threatening rock, good for government PR and giving 
invaders a head-ache - hopefully.

Errors: Original USP contains errors in computer, sand, fusion & missile stats.

Notes:
J3 M4 Agility 4 More a carrier than a cruiser, the Arakoine is not intended for main Fleet Operations. Rather she is a versatile ship intended for System domination missions either ahead of or following the main battle fleets. Supported by Escorts, Troop Transports and Auxiliaries the Strike Cruiser will fight through light system defences and support Imperial Army ground operations with fire support, a Heavy Fighter wing and Marines for surgical strikes. 

Nuclear Damper-9, Meson Screen-9 and a Dispersed Structure gives good defences vs Ground based Missiles and deep Meson sites. An extensive cargo bay may be used by the Imperial Army to initially transport Army elements and after delivery, may be used as an off planet field hospital and supply depot. It should be noted that the Marine and Army areas are segregated with security being provided by Navy Shipboard Security.

Notes:
J5 M2 Agility-0 A true multi-role Cruiser the Azhanti as a Fleet Intruder or the refitted Frontier Cruiser, is capable of dealing with most issues it will confront. Not intended for the battle line, the Azhanti in war will engage in asymmetrical warfare utilizing its J5 capability to show the flag, display force to wavering systems and raid supply lines. In peace the Azhanti undertakes political and scientific expeditions.

Much maligned by most commentators seeking to fit the Azhanti into a pure combat role, its capability and flexibility is often over-looked. 
With the upgrade to TL15 and re-designation as a Frontier Cruiser, the Azhanti with better screens, weapons, fighter complement, passenger/cargo capacity, etc., adds more capability for its missions - provided main fleet battle is not one of those missions.

Notes:
J3 M6 Agility-6 As a Strike Carrier, like the lighter Strike Cruiser, the Wind is intended to lead a force tasked with suppressing or capturing main worlds. Standard procedure is to jump to the Gas Giant, cover the task force while it refuels and jump in system to the main world for the strike or invasion. The Strike Carrier is an improvement on the Strike Cruiser, being armoured for the refueling run through the Gas Giant, better covering the task force from defending SBD's.

Notes:
J4 M2 Agility-2 The Fleet Carrier with its escorts is often allocated to a major battle fleet to supply fighter and small craft support for patrol 
and screening operations. Whilst the fighter wing is ineffective in main fleet battles vs TL15 capital ships, it should be remembered that most 
Imperial adversaries are at a technological disadvantage and in many cases the fighter wing is all that is needed.

Notes:
J3 M6 Agility-6. Whilst Imperial literature claims the Kokirrak class is J4 and meets the navies mobility standard, the evidence against this is 
significant. Primarily lack of jump fuel capacity, no evidence or sightings of the 20,000tn drop tanks otherwise required and no reports of 
manoeuvres where a J4 capability would have been used. Other misinformation relates to the use of a capital ship as a cargo/troop carrier 
when dedicated vessels are available to the navy and civilian transports can be impressed into service. Any situation requiring 
Dreadnoughts to deliver troops or cargo is undoubtedly one where the Dreadnoughts have failed in their primary mission.

Informed speculation ties the twin aspects of redundant cargo space and J4 propaganda. Reverse engineering shows this frees up enough 
space to provide significant benefits to a ship intended for the battle line, specifically better armour, back-up systems and replacement crew.

Changed: Armour-12 to -15, reduced J3 from J4
Added: Frozen watch, backup computer & screens. Fleet Admirals quarters, staff & c3 (Command, Control, Comms) capability, allowed 500tn
Removed: 4000tn cargo capacity. Imperial doctrine prefers using Dreadnoughts for combat not as troop transports!

Notes:

Plankwell with the Kokirrak; Amour-10 vs 12, Agility-5 vs 6, Meson screen-4 vs 8. None-the-less the Plankwell is a capable capital ship.

Added: Backup computers & screens, frozen watch

Notes:
J3 M6 Agility-6 The Tigress is a throwback to a golden age of starfaring where fighter carrying Dreadnoughts ruled the stars and Heavy Fighters in strength could defeat most opponents in the line of battle. In todays age, fighters are redundent when engaging in main fleet battles between high tech forces. Still, they are useful for many other roles, but ordering fighters into the battle line is tantamount to murder.

For the cost of the Tigress, the Imperium can field nearly 3 Plankwell Dreadnoughts or 2 Plankwells and 2 Fleet Carriers with 600 heavy fighters. Obviously the Navies intention for the Tigress is not just another Dreadnought. With the addition of several Fleet Destroyer escorts, a single Tigress is a task force in itself, capable of taking on heavily defended systems. Arguably the Tigress is not a Dreadnought, it is a political statement.

Jump-4 propaganda, again appears to be part of the misinformation campaign generated by the Imperial Navy. 3 parsecs of jump fuel is 
carried and no sightings of a 50,000tn drop tank has been reported. It is difficult to confirm Navy manoeuvres, but there is no evidence in the 
public record to support a jump-4 capability.

The re-reinforced Marine Company can be extended by displacing Shipboard Security and using cargo capacity for heavy weapons. Meaning 
that a Marine Battalion with supporting tanks may be carried for ground operations, supported by the Tigress and 300 heavy fighters. 

Added: Frozen watch x 2, Marines x 250, additional 50tn small craft x 40, a 4th launch tube - allowing the entire fighter compliment to be 
launched in two turns, back-up computers.
