Subject: MT Conversions (whats left)  



Hi,

Still to come are:
Combat tables
Fairly straight forward, just time consuming.

Antimatter Power Plants
I need to do a few calculations to convert the volume based PP's
to percentage based PP's.

Computers
The volumes/weights don't match up but MT does have Control Panels
as well as comps..... I'll try and find a pattern to extend the
computer table.....

Hull Configs
I can't find a good way to convert the MT configs and prices to HG.
Config 0 will be added. An alternative would be to use Book 2 style
streamlining ie. +10% hull price. with partial streamlining being +5%.
(the 10% in book 2 also pays for scoops and purifiers but this would
not be applied to HG).
This would give the following:

Config  Unstream Partial Full
1         +10%    +15%    +20%
2         +0%     +5%     +10%
3         -5%     +0%
4         -45%    -40%
5         -35%    -30%
6         -30%    -25%    -20%
7         -50%
8         +0%
9         +0%

Whats not coming:
MT has complex hull calculations (compared to HG) these don't really
add anything so have been missed.
MT Hull armour is simply = 3xHG + 40. No need to convert but will be
useful if you want to convert MT ship designs.
Jump Drives only cost 3 MCr per ton in MT.
There are two maneuver drive types in MT Thrusters at 0.7MCr and
Anti-Grav at 0.5. Adding this would change existing designs.
Comms and Sensors are added, sensors are too big a change to add to
HG.
Optimised Screens would probably change a lot of ship designs and
so have been left out.
MT Crew calculations are based on CP's. and I prefer the HG ones
anyway. They do use crew segments instead of crew USP for combat damage 
similar to the JTAS article.
Oh yeah, subordinate craft volumes are calculated as per TCS.

Nearly done.
