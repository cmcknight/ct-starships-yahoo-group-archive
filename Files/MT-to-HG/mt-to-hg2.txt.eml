Subject: More MT to HG conversions  



Hi,

I spent some time at the weekend playing with reverse engineering MT
weapons, drives, computers etc. back to HG. My idea is to expand
the HG system to allow for the extra technology in MT without changing
the core HG system.

Last week I posted a list of turret weapons and said that next would
be spinal mounts, I have a complete list of spinal mounts now but it's
still on lots of bits of paper that I need to get typed up onto a
computer, and I'm watching the football tonight so you'll have to
wait :)

But in the mean time here's a few other ideas for higher levels of
tech in HG:

Power Plants:
Replace the Power Plant table on page 23 with:
Percent      Tech level
times     7-8 9-12 13-14 15   16+
Pn         4   3     2    1  0.86

(0.86 = 6/7)(ish)

Jump Fuel:
Replace the Jump Drive paragraph in the Fuel Requirements section of page 23 
with:
Tech       Percentage of ships tonnage
Level      per Jump number
9-16       10%
17         8%
18         6%
19         4%
20         2%
21         1%

Hulls are proving a bit tricky, the definitions of streamlining in
MT don't really match with those in HG. According to my MT Errata
sheet MT Airframe=HG Streamlined and MT Streamlined=HG Partial
Streamline. This doesn't seem quite right, HG Partial streamlined
ships can only skim fuel from GG's. MT Streamline can land on planets.

A better solution may be to allow 4 levels of streamlining:
1: Nonstreamlined
2: Partial
3: Streamlined
4: Airframe

Airframe isn't much use in HG games unless you invent rules for combat
within atmospheres.

Comments?
