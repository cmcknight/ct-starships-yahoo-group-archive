Subject: MT turret weapons in HG  



Hi (again),

Someone, a while ago, mentioned something about adapting bits of the
MT ship design sequence for use with HG. I have decided to write up
some extentions to the HG rules to allow the use of some of the extra
options allowed in MT. Luckily the two design systems are (fairly)
similar.

I'll post the results bit by bit as I do them, if there's enough
interest I'll stick it all together in one document and I'll put
it on a web site somewhere. I'd quite like to rewrite the HG design
sequence to include these extra and publish the whole thing, but
I'm not sure that it would be legal :)

First up: Turrets

Despite the different presentation between the HG and MT the turret
weapons are virtually unchanged, MT uses a different power rating
but clearly states that 250 MW = 1 EP. Double checking the tables
shows that none of the power rating have changed.

None of the USP calculations are significantly different either, 3
beam lasers still gives a USP of 3 etc. MT did allow higher TL's
(upto 21 in fact) so it is possible to get a +3 bonus to a USP and
so the maximum USP rises to A (10).

Also Disintegrator turrets were added (TL 18!) and Particle
accelerators were expanded on slightly.

To use these new options all you need do is change the table on
page 25 of HG in the following ways:

Change the "TL Modif +2" row to be:
Missile: 21+
Beam:    16+
Pulse:   16+
Plasma:  12+
Fusion:  17+
Sand:    10+

Add a "TL Modif +3" row:
Plasma:  16+
Sand:    16+
Others:  -

Remove the PA and PA Barbette columns (they are both in the new PA
column) and add two new columns:

USP           PA    Disintegrator
1              1       1
2              2       4
3              4      10
4              6      16
5              8      20
6             10       -
7              -       -

TL Avail:     14      18
EP:            5      20
TL Modif +1:  15+      -
TL Modif +2:  16+      -
TL Modif +3:  18+      -
Weight:        *       2
Cost:         **       5

* Weight is 5t at TL14, 3t at 15, 2t at 16 and 1t at 18.
** Cost is 4MCr at TL14, 3MCr at 15+

You can have 2 disintegrators per turret.

(The completed document will have a complete table)
Thats about it for turrets, the combat tables will need extending
but I'll do that after I've completed all the weapons tables.

Next up: Spinal Mounted Jump Projectors :)
