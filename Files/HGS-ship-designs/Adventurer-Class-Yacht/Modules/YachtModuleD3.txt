COMMENTS
In 1077 the firm Section F Mercenaries, Inc, contracted for an Adventurer class starship and a standard yacht module D3. The two double sized staterooms in the ship's main hull were converted into four standard sized staterooms. The old jump-1 drive was removed, the outer hull was modified and the space converted to carry a Lt. APC. Section F Mercenaries has gained a good reputation for completing several high-risk commando tickets.
