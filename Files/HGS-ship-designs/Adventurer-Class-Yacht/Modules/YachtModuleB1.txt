COMMENTS
In 1077 the firm Section Eight Mercenaries, LLP, contracted for an Adventurer class starship and a standard yacht module B1. The two double sized staterooms in the ship's main hull were converted into four standard sized staterooms. Once acquired, Section Eight Mercenaries fitted two autodocs into the module. After a few missions, Section Eight Mercenaries added two 2 dton drones, one recon and the other medical. Before the ship's medic and one gunner operated the ship's air-raft as a medical sled. The firm has gained a good reputation for completing dozens of commando tickets.
