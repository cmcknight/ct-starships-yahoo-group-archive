COMMENTS
In 1081 Count Bornelos contracted for a luxury module and Adventurer class starship. Any visiting nobles quarter in the ship's forward passenger staterooms. The module's customized layout upper deck serves as the private quarters of the Count and his family. His aides occupy the lower deck of the module. The Iris door in the Count's bedroom is a one-way door into the cargo / vehicle bay.

NOTES
Two instructional robots teach the Count's children (max 4). One instructional robot teaches the aides's children (max 3). Each deck of the module has it's chief steward robot limited to it's deck of service. The third steward robots is less capable than the other two and assists either one with duties. The instructional and chief steward robots has medium security programs running. The last steward has minimum security programming. There are at least four security robots on the ship, protecting the Count and his family, the ship's occupants, and the ship itself.
