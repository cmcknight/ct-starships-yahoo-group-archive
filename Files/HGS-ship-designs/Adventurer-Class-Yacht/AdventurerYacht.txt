COMMENTS
In 1077 the Duke of Srys commissioned the design and construction of a yacht for his second son Yar. The design became popular several years later when Yar, utilizing collapsible fuel tanks, reached Capital in a tour of the Imperium. Corporate executives and other nobles commissioned more ships in the class. The design's two double staterooms, ample cargo capacity and modest cost make it a popular ship as a yacht.

NOTES
The upper deck is slightly smaller than the lower deck. (Align the cargo areas without covering the maneuver drive spaces to fit correctly.) Fuel is carried in the fuel bubbles encompassing three-quarters of the ship as shown in diagram one. The interior ladder allows access to the lower cargo deck from the upper deck.
