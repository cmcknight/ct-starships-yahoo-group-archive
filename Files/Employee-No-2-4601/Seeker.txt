COMMENTS
The Seeker is a Type-S2 Scout/Courier modified for astroid prospecting and mining work.
The Air/Raft, two of the staterooms and some of the crew space have been removed to allow for
a larger cargo bay. The Seeker's cargo bay is loaded from the rear acess door/ramp, which is 
9 meters wide and 3 meters high.
